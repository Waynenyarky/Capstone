So yesterday, I went to a business one-stop shop of Alaminos Pangasinan, and I found out a couple of things about how they process permits and stuff like that. Remember, this is for our capstone project. I know that you have a memory of that. Now, here's the thing. When I interviewed their BPLO officer, I found out that a lot of our features follow the wrong workflows. So basically, let me start with permit, how they process permits. So I recently found out, I basically I found out that they don't do paper-based workflows anymore. Well, sort of. They require business owners to fill out a form to wherein upon submission, they will first, the officer will then verify if the details inside that, if the details that are filled out in that form is correct and valid. Now, once the officer does that, they will now encode what was written in that form to their own system. Now, their system is, it's what I would say a good system. And that's because if I can label it in one word, it's tightly integrated. Yeah, it's integrated with every office that that city has. So basically, when you apply for a permit, you will only fill out one form, and the only, probably the only thing that's required from you is your ID, and that's it. When it comes to other required documents such as the community tax certificate, when it comes to tax permits and whatsoever, the system, well, basically the officers, will create those certificates for you, and basically the business owner doesn't have to do anything else. And the entire process takes 20 minutes. And literally, after that 20 minutes, if the, what do you call this, if there are no lines in the office, like, you could be out there in, like, well, yeah, in 20 minutes, you could, you would already receive your business permit.

Now, if there are any, if there's about the permit processing, what do you call this? I was told that the first step to basically doing your, to basically getting your permit is to first make sure that you have a record in their database. Now, that means that the business owner has to be signed up, or they need to have an account in their, it's not really an account, basically a record that they will need to, they will need, no, the officer will have to create a record for the business owner in the personal information system of the office if they don't have a record there yet. Now, after they've been, after they've... Then added to that system, I guess. Then the next thing that the officer will do is to create your permit. Now in this step, they require, this is where the form that, the one form that the business owner will fill out comes into play. So basically, in this one form, we have a bunch of fields, but the most important thing that, the most important section here is the business activity, wherein this is where the business owner will fill out what are their business activities. Basically, do they sell groceries? Do they sell fireworks? Do they sell hardware? Do they sell hardware stuff? Do they sell carpentry stuff? Do they sell machinery? Every type of product, there is basically a, what do you call this, a tax code, which is which is just letters from A to Z. Now when I When I talked to, when I had a conversation with the officer, it seemed as if he knew what all of those letters meant from memory, which is And after what do you call this? And when you click on a tax code, the appropriate line of business for that tax code is shown when you click on the line of business field. Basically, the tax code, the line of business, and the detailed line of business, they are not like text fields. They are drop-downs. So basically, I want you to search on, like, yeah, AI. I want you to search on the web what, if you can look for the different tax codes and detailed line of business, if possible, all right? Because apparently, these tax codes will have a major impact on what you will have. This, what do you call this? This business activity section is going to be the one that is going to determine what you will have, what the business owner will have to pay. So let's say, for instance, you sell fireworks, that's like a different thing. You sell machineries, that's a different thing. You sell real estate properties, that's a different fee, and so on. Now...Here's some more information. When I saw the system, the officers still has to pick if the owner is leasing the property that their business is on. So if they own the location, that can... what do you call this? I don't know how to explain it, but it'll kind of influence the... I'm not sure yet, but I think you need to research on this, but I will just assume that if a business owner is leasing their property, that will have an effect on the fees that they're gonna have to pay. Now, if they own the property, yeah, it's a different thing. They're gonna have to pay a different fee as well. And yeah, if the business owner is leasing the property for their business, they're gonna have to indicate as well what is the business address of the leaseor. They're gonna have to indicate the address of the leaseor and whatnot whatsoever. What else? Right, so when it comes to renewal, or when it comes to renewal, apparently, every January, like, there are 20 to, I don't know, days wherein every business must submit a renewal form for their business, and that applies to every business, right? And yeah, in the, so basically, my office, the officer told me that every January, things get busy in the office itself. There's like long lines and whatnot. Now, um... If I have to add more information about their renewal processes, the officer told me that it is just a simple process. Like, when the business owner lines up to get their renewal, yeah, to get their business renewed, it's a simple, it's a very simple transaction. It's quite, yeah, it's a fast one. You just have to be there. Yeah, the owner or the representative of the business will just have to be there with their business plate number, and basically the business officer would just have to give them... Oh no, it's not a simple process. I'm sorry, I forgot. When the business, when it is time to renew their business permit, the officer will have to request information about their financial statements and a few other requirements. But yeah. I don't remember much about the renewal process. I'm gonna have to ask more information about that. But I was just told that it was simple, it was quick and easy, and that I remember that they only have to submit their financial documents. They have to report how much money they've earned and whatsoever, so that they can then be given the amount of fees they're gonna have to pay for the current year. And also, another thing, say for instance, you applied for a business permit on December of 2025, you will have to renew your permit again on January. So yeah, like, regardless if the expiration of a permit is every The expiration of every permit for a year is the start of the next year. Right? So yeah, that's it about the renewal process, I guess. Now for the Now for the There's also another type of permit which is called the general permit, wherein this is applied to This is applied to businesses that are, well, small. Like for instance, I don't know if some of these are small, but if you are a cooperative business, if you are an association or foundation business, if you are a chainsaw permit business. I mean, I think this is a chainsaw permit. I'm not sure what that is, but I think that is concerned with forest stuff or whatever. There's also a firecracker stall holder. Yeah, the general permit applies to firecracker stall holders. It applies to bazaar, festivals, Christmas bazaar, vendors, peddlers. It applies to events where businesses promote or exhibit stuff. It applies to cemetery stall holders. It applies to fish trap, fish bin, stall holder. I think this is not a stall holder. This is a... Okay, I'm not sure. It also applies to fish pond. I mean, right now I'm currently reading a, what do you call this, like a requirement list for all of these businesses, I guess you could say. But yeah, I don't have anything else to say for now.Now, let's focus on the retirement of businesses. So in Alameda, when a business owner wants to retire their business, they're going to have to submit an application for the retirement of business, wherein they're going to have to fill out the— Right now, I'm holding a paper for— It's basically a letter to the city treasurer that the business owner is going to apply for the retirement of their business with their business permit. Basically, they're going to have to give the name of the business with their business permit number, their address, and how many years they've been active. Well, that's about it. And now, I think, after they submit this, it seems that there's still going to be inspectors that are going to inspect if the business has been retired. Yeah. Like, if the state of the business has been retired or not. Now, I guess that's it for retirement of business. Now, if the business owner forgets to retire a business, basically, what will happen is every year— Oh yeah, I forgot about that. When a business forgets to renew their permit, or if they— What do you call this? If they— If they did not meet the compliance period for renewing their business permit license, they're going to have to pay a penalty fee, wherein 25% of the first quarter of their income basically becomes the penalty. So, for instance, if the business earns 100,000 pesos in the first quarter, the penalty that they will receive if they forget to, I mean, not really forget, but if they fail to comply within the compliance period is 25% of their penalty fee, which in this case is 25,000 pesos. Now, that's only for their first quarter, okay? Now, when they still forget to renew their permit in the upcoming months, every month, 2% interest is going to be applied to the penalty. Now, what else? Now, let's say a business forgets to, oh, wait, let's say an owner decides to surrender their, no, not really surrender, a business owner somehow forgets to terminate their business, maybe that owner abandons the business entirely. What's... Now, if you ask how will the BPLO officer, I mean, how will the BPLO know that a business has been abandoned by its own business owner? Well, I was told that every, let's say, a business, yeah, what do you call this? When they renew their permit, wait, wait, wait, let's say it's time for, it's January, every business is renewing their business permit and whatsoever. Now let's say it's March, and this one business hasn't renewed their business permit license yet. Now, what will happen is, a few inspection or maybe just one inspection officer will go to the business that forgot to, well, let's just say forgot for now, that forgot to renew their permit. And if the business and if the inspector notices or observes that the business is not really working, it's not really functional anymore, it's closed, the BPLO will have to report that the business is now closed due to close based on the inspection results. Now, if the business owner somehow decides to come back to that abandoned business, they will have to sort out The penalty fees they're gonna have to pay because they abandoned their business, right? So, yeah, before they can apply for a new business permit and whatsoever, they need to sort out the issue with that business first. Okay, now, right, let's say you close the business, but then you wanna open it again, you will receive a different business permit license number. It is not going to be the same anymore. Oh yeah, every active businesses, they will still have the same business permit number. Yeah, that will remain unchanged until they decide to close the business. I guess that's it.Another thing, now I have here in my hand is the mayor's permit for occupation application form. When I talked to the officer, they told me that this permit right here is for the employees of that business. So, if a business has five employees, they're going to have to submit five of these forms. Five of this form. I've got, I mean, five individual copies of this form for every employee that they have. If they have a hundred, they're going to have to submit a hundred as well. Now, this form right here takes about, I was told that this takes about 30 days to complete. That's because in this form, I think they're going to have to get the results for their laboratory examinations. So if you're a food handler, they need to get your, if your employee is a food handler, they need to get urinalysis test done, fecalysis, Hepa-B screening test, and chest x-ray. If they are a non-food handler, they need to do some drug test and some chest x-ray. Now in the event that an employee does get, what do you call this, in the event that an employee is found to be diagnosed with some sort of disease and whatsoever, they are given a recovery period. They can be given a recovery period to make sure that before they work, They are healthy, all right? Usually, I think it's one month, but the business owner can still decide to maybe kick out the employee if, let's say, the result of an employee contains some sort of diagnosis that the employee has some sort of terminal disease that needs to be... that needs extreme recovery. So, yeah. I mean, it makes sense if an employee has cancer, it's probably best to make sure that that employee is recovered first before they can work again. So, yeah, so for this permit, I guess, yeah, it also asks if personal information about the employee. It asks about their educational background and whatnot. And I guess that's it for this occupational application form. Okay, now it's time to talk about inspections. So I was told that uh I was told that after you, after you get your permit, the business, the office will schedule an inspection appointment for the business. So basically, they will uh tell the business owner that the date of when the officer, if when an officer will come to their business and inspect their place. Now, they will have to inspect, of course, for the usual stuff. Um, they're gonna have to inspect uh uh yeah, it's a joint inspection, maybe uh this joint inspection team will consist of four to five members where they will have to uh maybe each officer will inspect, uh wait, maybe one officer will inspect uh the health side of things, one officer will inspect the fire protection side of things, one officer will inspect the sanitary side of things and whatnot. I, I'm not sure what other, what other offices, but yeah, you may need to search about that. Um, so yeah, after the uh now, after the uh if the inspection is deemed successful, there will be no more upcoming inspections in the future for that business for the entire year. Now, when the and now when if a officer spots a uh what do you call this, not really a mistake, but they notice something that needs to be worked on, like, let's say, a building, the building that the user, the building that the business owner is on is unsafe, for instance, then the inspection team will report back to the BPLO office that, yeah, about the issue, and then the business owner is given a compliance period to fix the issue. Now this is, now this compliance period is not fixed. If the issue needs like a lot of time, they will give the BPLO office will give them a lot of time to fix the issue. But yeah, in the event that, yeah, if they fix the issue, then the inspection, the inspector officer will probably come back on the deadline to inspect if the issue has been fixed or not. And then yeah, the same if the inspection is successful again, the inspector will not have to visit the business for until the year ends. Now, if the business owner did not comply with that requirement, I mean, did not comply within the compliance period to fix the issue, if the reason is valid, maybe it's still unfinished, maybe there's still, maybe the, what do you call this, the deadline can still be extended. But in the event that, well, the business owner Still does not comply with the requirements, then they're gonna be penalized. Now, for this penalty fee, I'm not sure how... I think I didn't ask how much the fee is, but yeah. I'm gonna have to ask them about this question soon. Yeah, what else?Okay, so I don't remember much about this thing. I guess that's it for now. Now let's talk about violations. Oh wait, well, that is indeed a violation. Oh yeah, so when a, let's say a customer complains about the business doing some weird stuff, or yeah, the first thing that they need to do first is to report the business to the barangay hall first. And if the barangay hall thinks that the office, that the BPLO office needs intervention, then the barangay hall will then talk to the office for guidance on how to deal with the complaint sent by the customer. Now, yeah, when that happens, the inspector will then have to visit the business again to inspect the place for any violations and whatsoever. And yeah, they will be penalized for it if the evidences are true and whatnot. But yeah, I haven't really, we didn't really, what do you call this? We didn't really talk much about this topic because it basically does never happens. It seems that the business owners in Alaminos City are very law, what do you call this? They're law-abiding citizens. Moving on, oh yeah, I forgot. And then, okay, so let's say a business, let's say a business owner, let's go, let's talk about inspection. Let's talk about inspections again. If a business owner is found to be guilty of not complying with a, yeah, with an issue that they, yeah, with the requirement that needs to be fixed or whatever, the next inspection, basically, what will happen is the office will not tell them when the next inspection date will happen. So it becomes a surprise to them. I mean, it becomes a surprise to the business owner. What do you call this? Not really a surprise, but like the, yeah, the inspector will randomly go to their office one day to inspect the business. And then if they seem to violate the rule again, that's when they will be forcefully, their business permit license will forcefully be revoked, and maybe then probably authorities will now get involved when it comes to, yeah, when it comes to the issues. that the business still currently has. So we've talked about a few things already. We've talked about the permit processing itself, the inspection stuff, the violation stuff, the... Okay, I forgot about... Okay, have I even discussed complaints? I think I did. So when a customer complains about a business, they first have to go to a barangay hall to sort out the issue, and if the BPLO needs to intervene, then the barangay hall will need to talk to the BPLO to have an inspector visit the business itself and see whether or not the business has violated some business rules and whatnot. Now, yeah, I think I did, so never mind. So we have processing, we have... Uh, we have... Okay, so I can't think of anything anymore. We've already discussed retirement. We discussed renewals. We've discussed... Right. Oh, okay. So let's say an inspector or an officer made a mistake in their activities when it comes to, like, you know, processing their permits, inspecting their businesses. Like, they made a mistake in maybe, uh, they made a mistake in pointing out that this business has clearly violated this when they didn't. Maybe it's a misclick or something of the sort. And when that happens, the owner will have to submit an appeal. Yeah, basically an appeal to basically correct the mistake if it is indeed a mistake. Like, for instance, yeah, yeah, I think you, that's common sense already. Now, now that I told you about all these stuff, let's, I actually want you to help me, what do you call this? So, we already have the existing project, right? I want you to plan out what needs to be changed, what needs to be done, and that sort of thing. You know, so basically this will be a very, very, very hard task, and I will be using, you know, a very good model for this. Yeah, I'll be using you to do all this stuff, and I wanna make sure that somehow you don't make a mistake, or I'm not sure, but I want you to first make sure that the things I've said a while ago needs to be, needs to be, needs to now be a concise list of requirements. If possible, I want you to think about ways on how to mitigate risks early on. Like, I'm not sure how I can, like... See the stuffy, but yeah, I'm just gonna...Now when it comes to the, again, to the project, I think you may need to make a lot, a lot of changes due to the fact that, well, we've already identified how BPLLO does their stuff, and, well, yeah, we kind of need to make sure to plan out the changes we need to make in the project itself. Like, a lot of it is not really aligned with how BPLLO expects stuff to work, and if anything, like, I am right now, the first, one of the requests that I, one of the my requirements from you is to create a very, very cohesive plan that addresses all features that we need to do, right? Um, like, in this plan, I want you to carry out a lot of the things that are possible to, like, list down and stuff like that, even the, um, like, layout-wise, what are the buttons that we need to add, the search buttons, the filter buttons, the logs, the, I don't know what else, but like, yeah, um, I don't, I don't even know what else do we need to discuss. Like, for instance, how would you propose the feature of, like, because, like, um, before, uh, after getting the business permit, they still need to get uh their sanitary permit, uh, their fire protection permit, is that a thing? I'm not sure, like, I want you to search about that. I want you to, uh, what else? I want you to do some research on how people, uh, I mean, how uh LGU units, like, record stuff or, I don't know, it's a lot of stuff that... I'm now assuming, so I guess the big mistake that we did earlier is that we assumed the workflow of BLPLLO, but then we just found out that, well, a lot of our workflows are mistakes. And yeah, also, I want you to, like, I know I'm not sure how we're gonna do this, but like, one of the requirements in the business, like, most of the requirements in the business permit processing is that every, I mean, every business owner must be registered in the PIS or the personal information systems. Yeah, yeah. Basically, so when you are a new user in the app, you basically maybe the PIS is already, you're like information, you know, like when you sign up, that's when you sign up for the first time, that's already your PIS, like, but we need to add the address of the user and address of the, yeah, of the business owner and their marital status in that registration, you know. So, yeah, what else do I need to add? Oh yeah, also, when it comes to the PIS, like, for instance, some of us, we cannot have duplicate records, you know. So if possible, should there be a, can you think of a way to, like, mitigate the possibility of someone re-registering... another account for the same identity, you know? Like, for instance, this business owner attempted to create a new account on using our site, but then they already have a record in the BIS, so we need to mitigate that. Also, I wanna mention how, yeah, so we need our application, I mean, our website needs to support walk-in appointments, as in, because, like, yeah, this is definitely a big, big requirement. So let's say another feature, yeah, this feature needs to be really implement, I mean, yeah, it needs to be implemented, but like, I'm just gonna have to explain my thought process, the ideas that are popping out in my head right now. So my, the professor that I talked to, I mean, the officer that I talked to told me that whenever a business owner comes to their office, like a walk-in appointment, what happens is, is that after they, you know, they've interviewed, they feel that they've, what happens is, after they've, again, let me rephrase that. So when a business owner walks in for, to apply for a permit, for a new permit, what they need to do is, first, they fill out a form. If they need assistance, they could go ahead and ask what the, yeah, they can go ahead and ask assistance from an officer. And then once they fill out the forms completely, then that form gets encoded to their system. But first, the personal information that they've filled out in that form needs to be What do you call this? They need to be added to the PIS system, okay, the Personal Information System. And then after being added to the Personal Information System, and then they register the details about their business and whatsoever. I'm pretty sure I already mentioned to you about the different tax codes, like the business activities, the detailed line of activities and whatnot. I want you to also research on how they do that. And also, yeah, I want you to also make sure that when, if, like, even in the registration thing, like, can you think of, like, for instance, a business owner already has a PIS, a business owner already has a record in the PIS thing, but then they attempt to create a new account using our website. And how can we mitigate duplicate accounts? Is there, like, a way to, like, confirm the identity of one person, like, you know? So yeah. Another thing, what else do I need to tell you? I'm not sure anymore. Okay, so... Also, yeah, right now I'm thinking about that problem, so... I was thinking maybe when the user attempts, I mean, okay, so a business owner is already in the PIS or the personal information system, right? So probably their email is already included in the PIS. So when a user attempts, I mean, when a business owner attempts to create a new account, they could probably choose to say, choose an option to, I already choose the option, I already have a, I have a, I have signed, I have some sort of phrase that I have already renewed my permit once or something of the sort, which when they click on that button, then they will be transferred to another form instead of the actual registration form to the PIS. They will be directed to like another form wherein it asks for their email and if their email, their details, and whatnot, and if the computer finds a match, then a code will be sent to their email about their, to the email that's been listed in the, yeah, to the PIS, and then, yeah, they'll be sent a code and stuff like that. You know, right now I am referring to, right now I am remembering how I got access to my insurance account just by... using my email account and my policy number that's written in my Sun Life insurance envelope book, you know? I have the physical copy, so yeah. What do you call this? Yeah, I guess that's another feature you need to think about. And yeah, you need to really plan out that feature and whatnot.Right, in the system, we already have a, what do you call this, disform definition feature wherein, yeah, it's basically, like, the contents of it is wrong now, I guess, but I'm not sure, whatever. Like, the industry, it's not, like, the process is not like that anymore, right? So what we're gonna do instead is that, right now, okay, one of the forms that it will have is the unified form. I will probably send you a copy of this. Wherein, yeah, it's a, this is probably, I was told that this application form gets rarely changed, but when it does get changed, we will, this form definition will, this form definition feature will solve that. But, yeah, right now, the current contents of the form definition feature is probably wrong now because, well, basically, the DPLO of Alaminos processes different kinds of permits, or I think there's only one permit. Actually, the officer told me that this is, this permit that I'm holding right now is called a unified business permit form, which is probably a smart idea considering that there's so many types of businesses selling different types of products and services. It's just that this, what do you call this, this unified business form has this section about the business activity wherein we have the, like for instance, if you're the officer, you need to identify the code, the line of business, and the detailed line of business that the business is offering to customers, right? So yeah, I probably need you to research on that. I wasn't given a copy on stuff like this, but um yeah. So yeah, I've already told you about this, but um yeah. Also, again, I'm just gonna reiterate the fact that um when it comes to like changing information about the business, uh about the business, it's quite easy, you know? Like, a business owner might just come and they can request a change, and yeah, I was told that it's just a quick fix. And um yeah, I guess that's it for this. What else do I need to tell you? Oh yeah, right now, I don't have, I don't have any idea what the LGU manager in our system will do. Originally, this LGU manager um had tasks, or maybe they will see a dashboard about the different um I don't know, I'm not sure how uh I'm not sure what the LGU will do in our project, but I'm probably gonna ask, have to ask you to think about, yeah, to brainstorm on what the LGU manager can do. Maybe the LGU manager can like manage the different inspectors that we have, see their progress, and stuff like that. I'm not sure yet, but um yeah, probably um the LGU managers must... Well, we'll see data about the different, yeah, the inspectors and officers that are, officer staff that are in their office. Yeah, every LGU manager belongs to only one department, all right? So, yeah, what else do I need to tell you? Regarding the LGU manager, maybe the LGU manager can also, like, see complaints or something like that. I'm not sure. Or maybe I think the LGU manager will have to probably be the one to, like, see complaints when those arise. Maybe, oh yeah, the business owner also can be, the business owner can also appeal, right, about the mistakes their officers or inspector officers may have made during inspections or, you know, processing and stuff like that, so they can appeal stuff like that. So maybe LGU manager will be the one to be alerted by those kinds of stuff. Maybe, what else can the LGU manager do? Yeah, I'm not sure. Maybe they can also be the one to like, I'm not sure yet. I want you to research on the possible stuff that the LGU manager can do, right? Yeah, I want you to list out everything that it can do, okay? Even for the business owner, oh yeah, the payment methods. Oh yeah, the payment methods. So, one of the things missing in the form definitions feature are the payments, basically, for... Oh wait, no, no, no, no. Okay, I'm not sure about this anymore. So, I took a picture of their citizen's charter and... And in the citizen's charter, there is a column called fees to be paid, wherein it basically lists out the different fees that a business is required to pay upon registering a business. And well, of course, there are times when these stuff changes, right? So probably we're gonna have to, like, um, need a way to, like, uh, edit this, you know? Like, yeah, if possible, basically, um, I don't know if you're gonna include it in the form definitions page or in another separate page, but um, yeah, I think it needs to be editable, but that that depends on you. Uh, I want you to think what's the best thing to do here, okay? Um, oh yeah, regarding the admin accounts, so it was just my idea to have three admin accounts. I'm not sure if this is the standard across, uh, Yeah, I'm not sure if this is the standard across like commercial websites or stuff like that, but I want you to like tell me if this is even possible or what do you call this, if this is even remotely correct, you know? So um, yeah, I don't know what else to say, maybe... Oh yeah, the different tax codes, yeah, the different tax codes, I mean the tax codes have an effect on what the final business permit fee will be, you know? If you are someone who sells fireworks, maybe you need to pay a small, you are paying a smaller fee, but when it comes to like maybe a machinery equipment or factory stuff, maybe they pay a larger fee, which will probably influence the amount of money they have to pay when it comes to processing their permit, renewing it, stuff like that. So um, yeah, I want you to research on this, if possible, if there's data online about this. Mm-hmm. Um, yeah. Yeah, I'll send you a copy of the City Business Permit and Licensing Office Citizens Charter. And um, yeah, what else do we need to tell you? Um... Maybe, uh, what can I remember, what can I remember? Oh yeah, the layout of the app. So there are parts of the application wherein, I mean, there are parts of the websites where it contains static data, I mean static design, which is wrong. Like for instance, in the business owner side of things, we have like a dashboard that is filled with static data. I want you to remove those now. All right?


Also, I'm gonna have to also uh require you to like update the mobile end of things because we also already have that. And um, yeah, I don't know what else to say. Um, yeah, also, I want you to know that the mobile end of things, only the inspector has access to the mobile application because it's well, it's required so that we can validate the um we can validate the um we can validate the authenticity of the pictures uploaded, like, we need to record their GPS of the picture taken, you know, and stuff like that. Also, yeah, I'm not sure what else to say. Um, oh yeah, fuck. Hmm. I'm not sure anymore, but um yeah. Also, probably we're gonna have to define the different uh I'm not sure, but um yeah, I just want you to like really uh do a really good job on the uh the things I'm telling you right now because tomorrow I'm gonna have to like present this and stuff like that. So I'm yeah.Now let's talk about the AI side of things. Now, our project title involves the word AI document validation tool, and well, that's an issue, that is one of the issues of our application right now. And yeah, our current AI model is trained with, is trained on validating IDs. And I've recently found out that the BPLO does not validate IDs, they do not validate like probably a lot of the documents and stuff like that. What they do is that once they collect the permit and once they collect the details, the ID details and whatnot, even the occupational permits, they just approve it. All right. And what they do is that every quarter or so, they will send what they've gathered to, like, offices in Manila, I guess. And then, yeah, the offices in Manila will have to, like, verify the data that has been sent to them, everything from the ID to passports and yeah. And if they spot discrepancies, if they spot fake stuff, then these different offices will alert BPLO about cases where business owners may have written the wrong or fake information. And so inspectors will then go to the business. And report to them that, well, the office has spotted discrepancies in their requirements and that they need to comply within a period of time. And yeah, if they don't comply, it's either they extend it more if the reason is plausible, but if not, they'll get penalized. Oh yeah, I'm not sure, but how do we even, how does our app, how will our app even determine how much business owners will have to pay, right? Is there like, I think there should be, there should also be a form where, I mean, in the admin side of things, there should probably be a, like a definition as well when it comes to penalties, where if the user violates this stuff, then they pay this stuff. That's defined by, yeah, it's encoded by the admin, but yeah, they were told they have a basis for that, you know, and probably every year or so, this penalty fee rises and stuff like that. So yeah, I don't want it to be static, you know. So yeah, as for the payment, as for the payment methods, probably just gonna require you to fake it for now, like once they click on continue, it just automatically succeeds. We don't have to connect to a third party right now because that's not really our priority. But yeah, I... I don't know if we missed out on something, but um, yeah. Alright. Oh yeah, when it comes to the AI document validation as well, yeah, the ID validation, let's remove that now. Yeah, even the model, like, I want you to remove it now. Alright. Instead, what we're gonna do is that our AI should validate the unified form. Basically, a while ago, we had a discussion, our professor in this topic had a discussion wherein he demonstrated how we can use generative AI, you know, a third-party AI, to, basically we can train it with a dataset that's been validated by an expert. Like, he demonstrated a mental health FAQ question and answer dataset wherein for every question there is a prepared answer. Now, this dataset is verified and validated by an expert, and yeah, we're gonna also have to show that in our capstone document, which I also will need to ask your help. I also need to, yeah, so stuff like that, I want you to help me with that. Like, he told me how we can use agentic AI to do stuff, to do the stuff with, and which is great because I thought that we weren't allowed to use third-party APIs, but yeah, I guess we can. And he also told me that... Uh, like, for instance, in our application, uh, I don't know, but I don't know, I don't really understand this, but he told me how there's, uh, there could probably be layers to this AI model that we have and that we should understand it, so I probably want to, um, probably will request, like, a, some sort of documentation on how uh how we did our AI, how we trained it, how we uh like, like there are steps to training a model, uh right, before we deploy it. So um, yeah, I want you to help me, I want you to, like, create a documentation on how we can do that and yeah, and how you did that, basically, because after this, I'm just gonna have to ask you to train the model on your own, okay? Like, what's the best step to take and whatnot, like the, even the validated datasets, probably I will just uh require you to create one for now. I know we, I know it hasn't been validated by a uh validated by a professor, I mean, for, uh I know it hasn't been validated by a an actual BPLO officer, but I just want you to create one because uh we are going to visit that officer next week, and we need this project done, like, literally uh tomorrow. So um, yeah, uh what else do I need to tell you? Um.I also need to tell you about the... I don't know what else to tell you. Like, oh yeah, the AI document validator thing. So yeah, this is a very important core feature of our project. And yeah, it's like included in our title, but um... What do you call this? Oh, yeah, so tomorrow we are going to present a working prototype of our project. I mean, a working prototype of this AI feature. And I want you to create a Jupyter notebook, uh, yeah, that basically resembles our actual model, wherein we can run it and do some tests with it, and stuff like that. Because tomorrow we are going to present how our prototype works. We're gonna have to test it as well. We're also gonna have to show a way to measure the accuracy of our model. Yeah, and stuff like that. I want you to do that. I also want you to, yeah, provide documentation on how to, like, do or run that, and stuff like that. I'm going to send you the requirements along with the, yeah, with this prompt. Um, I want you to make sure that it works, yeah, that totally. I want you to, um, okay, I think we are gonna have to move on to blockchain now. So for blockchain, I want you to remember that, yeah, this website will probably have different smart contracts, and we need to basically, uh, I don't know about this smart contract thing yet, but, um, yeah, it's like a smart ledger. I don't know if it's only one smart contract or more, but I was told that there was gonna be more than one, and I'm not sure why. But, um, okay, maybe one for logging, uh, like audit logs, one for document storage, and stuff like that, I guess. Uh, yeah, I'm not sure, and yeah, I need these to work, basically. Um, what else do I need to tell you? Yeah, also, this document, uh, I mean blockchain bit, we need a working prototype as well. Yeah, the same way, like, it needs to have, like, tests that it actually works. Yeah, with Ganache and everything. Yeah, um, what else do I need to tell you? Uh, maybe I'm just, I'm gonna take a look at the requirements.
So, one of the things that I am going to attach to this prompt is a document called Blockchain Prototype Plan. This is wrong, okay? And I want you to change it to basically match the core feature that we're gonna implement, okay, which is the AI document validator tool. And yeah, basically, I want you to change it, okay? Yeah, again, one of the requirements is to like keep it, I don't know, the sprints, don't mind about that, it will just take like days because well, we're gonna vibe code this entire application already. And yeah, what else do I need to tell you? Yeah, this is, I'm asking you to create the Jupyter Notebook file for this as well. Yeah, basically, I want you to make another document of the same format, but then it will be for another core feature, which will be the blockchain side of things. Yeah, so basically, this will be the audit stuff. And yeah, I want you to create the document for the audit feature, okay? So yeah, I also want you to create the notebook for it. Now, yeah, I guess that's it for this side of things.I also found another form just now, and this is called a post requirement, yeah, it's basically a requirement list wherein it says post requirements in securing mayor's permit for renewal, wherein they're going to have to like do some stuff for sanitary permit, building clearance, and fire safety inspection certificate. Um, yeah, so I guess the applicant is given 30 working days to comply with the requirements, or else they will result to temporary suspension or closure of the business operation. Another permit that I found is the post requirements in securing mayor's permit for new permit. They're gonna need to have a real property tax clearance, a garbage fee, a sanitary permit, zoning clearance, and fire safety inspection certificate. I do not have any idea how we will implement these stuff in our system, but yeah, you could probably research in that, or you could probably just, I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. But yeah, I want you to work on this as well.Now let's focus on the Capstone document. I have listed a lot of, like, yeah, I have attached a file called the Capstone chapter 2 requirements. And yeah, these are basically the requirements that the Capstone, the chapter 2 of the capstone document, yeah, it lists what it needs. And yeah, I also want you to, like, like predict, like, yeah, like when I went to the office, I kind of just asked them questions that are, that, yeah, it was recommended by me by another AI model. And yeah, it was basically an on-the-spot thing. I didn't really have a, I didn't really have like a proper documentation at hand because it was like a, I couldn't really write, I couldn't really like write down what they were saying. Like, I was just asking questions. Like, I did have a list, but then the list basically covered, was already being covered by them. They, while we were, while I was having a conversation with the officer, they basically just spontaneously said everything. I didn't really have to ask a lot. When it comes to the problems, they also, they even told me that there were no problems at all. It's just that the business, when it comes to the business owners, they make mistakes when filling out the form, which is why it's kind of recommended to just assist them with filling out the form. And yeah, I guess our AI document validator feature will solve that problem, I guess. Yeah. So we can't really, we can't really, I was also told that I wasn't allowed to like know how their, like, you know, their system works because, yeah, well, that's a lot of it is like confidential because, yeah, we're dealing with a government office here without, we can't really, they can't really tell me how they do stuff in their, do a lot of their security stuff in their system. Yeah, because, yeah, that's confidential. But, yeah, I don't know what else to say. I think I'm going to also need the, like, the primary source of data, like the contact details of the man I talked to, but, yeah, the officer I talked to. But yeah, I'm gonna list the name right now.: Wilfredo villenaI think you're probably gonna ask me to like, uh, like what kind of research are we gonna, like, research design we're gonna do. I'm not really sure, but it's up to you to think about what's the best thing to do here. And um yeah, even the techniques, yeah, it's up to you. That's up to you. And um, yeah, yeah, you're also, we're gonna also have to include this in the appendices form. Yeah, yeah, stuff like that. I want you to like, remind me to, uh, yeah, you're also probably gonna have to give me a list of to-dos for this major, major task that I provided you. Like for instance, you're gonna have to ask me to provide an API key for the generative AI from Gemini. You're gonna have to ask me to like fill out some of the stuff in the caption documents regarding the different forms. I'm probably gonna have to manually add the photos, right? For the forms that I use, um, you're gonna have to ask me to, uh, I mean, you're gonna have to ask me to manually add the forms that I received from BLO. Yeah, the photos, the scanned documents, uh, because that is required in the appendix of the document. Uh, you're gonna have to probably ask me to, um, I don't know what else you will ask me, but um, yeah. Uh, I guess that's it.So I attached another file called the Information Assurance and Security Checklist wherein it basically lists out all of the requirements that our project needs to have. So, yeah, I want you to implement each and every bit of the requirements listed in the file. Yeah, so yeah, that's it.I just remembered, our professor talked about how the prompts that we're going to be using to send to our generative AI model, AI needs to be validated and whatnot. So I guess you, I want you to create like a document about the different prompts that you use, so that we'll have a quick like reference that we can ask to our, like, to the officer that I talked to, and yeah, I want them to see the prompt that I use and see if it's valid or like, yeah, valid or not, like prompt, like, I don't know, yeah, I just need the like a documentation on what prompt our project is currently using, what are the prompts, yeah, stuff like that. Um, yeah, also this prompt needs to follow like proper format. Um, there is this like, uh, like, it needs to have a role, it needs to have like a, yeah, your vibe coding, like, I'm not sure how to, but yeah, there needs to be, you need to include the art of prompting here, okay, because our professor needs to, our professor is looking for that in our project. Um, but um, yeah, I guess there's nothing else I need to say right now.If you spot any inconsistencies in the project or the project documents, you are free to edit them as you like.Now, I don't know how else am I gonna have to say this, but like, I want you to make sure that everything that I wrote in this document is like, you know, like, it will be implemented properly and with high quality, you know, you get what I'm saying. But yeah, I need it to, I need you to not make any mistakes because tomorrow, well, yeah, it's gonna be a requirement, like you are free to um do some heavy thinking and stuff like that. You are free to do some heavy planning and whatnot on your end. But um yeah, I need you to test every bit. I need you to, like, yeah, to basically make sure that everything works. Ah yeah, so also, I want you to make sure that you have seeded your, you have some seeders ready as well for everything. I want you to like, yeah, yeah, we also have, we also have this like dev thing, like the bug, the FAB button, the floating action button. Yeah, I want you to utilize that. I want you to create tests for every scenario. Yeah, also, do you know black box and white box testing? Can you do that if possible? Um, yeah, I also want you to ask me a lot of questions, okay? I'm expecting that from you. Um, yeah, and also, when you ask me questions, if I am, uh, there's, there's a high chance that uh some of the questions that you're gonna give me are questions that I won't understand. So I want you to provide uh last option for me to say, I don't know. Or yeah, like in uh like a res, I know you can give me an option to like tell me, uh I mean, what do you call this? I know you can give me an option to like, for like me to like type out what I wanna do, or yeah, whatever. Um, yeah, ask for the model, like, do your best. Yeah, whatever. Um. Yeah, I want you to provide documentation for everything, I guess. You will probably need this checklist as well. Uh, I, I probably, I think you need the document, yeah, yeah, like the documentation checklist. I want you to do every bit of those. And um yeah, like if there's unnecessary stuff in the project, I want you to delete them. Yeah, um, I don't know how you're gonna do this, but um, I want you to do a good job and implementing all of this stuff, okay?Oh shoot, even for the backup as well, even for the archival of data, for the deletion of archived data, yeah, consider the data lifecycle, like how are we gonna do that? Oh my God, that's actually one of the stuff that I kind of left out when I started this project. But yeah, those things are important now. Yeah, I basically have no idea. Yeah, whatever.Also, if possible, I want you to list out the different features that you've implemented, like the summary of changes that you've made. Yeah, like every bit of change you made. Yeah, you need to do that. Also, in a separate document, I want you to list out the workflows that our app supports, okay? Like, yeah, I want you to support everything. Like, I mean, list down everything that our app supports right now. Like, yeah, it functions, basically. um, what else do I need you to list out? Like, the different documents. Oh yeah, I want you to like remove some of the documentations here that aren't unnecessary anymore. I also want you to, um, like, clean some stuff up, if possible. I want you to, um, yeah, delete unnecessary stuff, like the existing AI model that we have. Oh yeah, when it comes to the, like, reading forms, uh, I guess you can use generative AI for that, or because, yeah, the OCR that we have is like... It's not good, right? Yeah, I know it's not good, so I think you're gonna have to make sure that upon scanning a document, it works. Yeah, oh yeah, I forgot about that. Our app needs to base that blockchain thing, needs to, like, that blockchain notebook thing, needs to, like, have an interface as well. Or yeah, that AI and that blockchain interface, uh, what do you call this, that AI and blockchain core feature notebooks that we have, they need to have an interface, right? Like, we're gonna have to have an interface for both of these features, where, for instance, in our document validation prototype, yeah, we need to, like, be able to submit a document and the uh... Yeah, we also need to, like, upload a dataset that our generative AI is going to rely on. Like, yeah, stuff like that. Uh, yeah, yeah, it needs to, like, read the data, and then after reading the data, it needs to rely on the dataset that has been validated and stuff like that. You know, you get my point, I guess. And for the blockchain, I guess, there needs to be a button to, like, upload a file, and then I can see it on uh the IPFS already. Uh, yeah, I don't know, I'm not sure anymore. But um, yeah, even for the audit logs, yeah, uh, yeah, this is for the audit logs. But um, yeah, I guess that's it for now.

Also, I'm probably requiring you to create a document for identifying the different vulnerabilities we have in our blockchain and AI feature or prototype, and how we plan to solve it, if possible, like, yeah. But then again, I kind of want you to make a strong model already. So, yeah. Also, I want you to make sure that the encryption that we have... Yeah, oh, right. We need a SHA-256 encryption technique, I guess. We also need a re-entrancy attack test on blockchain, which can be mitigated using the only owner function in the solidity contract. Yeah, we need to have, like, a... Yeah, there needs to be security controls across the data lifecycle. I mean, the lifecycle of the different data that we have. For instance, from the... We need to have a security control from the creation of the data, the collection of data, the storage of data, the use or processing of data, the sharing or transmission of data, the retention or archiving of data, and the disposal or the destruction of data. We need to have, like, different... What do you call this? Different security controls for those. Oh yeah, if you want reference on how to like, yeah, for the flow of the, for like setting up a model, we have raw data, then preprocessing, then data splitting, then model training, which you can choose from six algorithms, which are SVM, RF, DT, LR, XGB, or NN. Then you optimize the model and then you deploy the model. You also like need to like prevent overfitting and undercutting of the model, or I don't know what that stuff is. Oh yeah, when it comes to the dataset, or never mind.

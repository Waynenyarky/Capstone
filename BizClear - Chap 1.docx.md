# **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

## **Background of the Study**

Business permit processing is a fundamental regulatory function of Local Government Units (LGUs) that ensures businesses operate legally, safely, and in compliance with established standards. Efficient permit processing is essential because it directly affects local economic activity, public safety, and public trust in government institutions. When permit systems are slow, fragmented, or poorly monitored, they can discourage entrepreneurship, delay investments, and weaken regulatory enforcement.

With the advancement of digital technologies, governments worldwide have increasingly adopted e-government systems to improve the efficiency, transparency, and accessibility of public services. Studies highlight that digital platforms reduce processing time, minimize human error, and allow real-time monitoring of transactions. The digital transformation of public administration has been recognized as a critical vector for modernizing government services, strengthening transparency, and enhancing citizen engagement (Ouboumlik & Ouazzani Touhami, 2024). More recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain have emerged as transformative technologies capable of further enhancing digital governance. AI has been widely used to automate document validation, detect inconsistencies, and support decision-making (Adesoga et al., 2024), while blockchain has been recognized for its ability to ensure data integrity, transparency, and tamper-proof recordkeeping (Kumar et al., 2023).

In the public sector, AI adoption has been shown to enhance efficiency, boost service delivery, and optimize resource allocation through automation and advanced AI utilization (Tveita & Hustad, 2025). However, effective AI implementation requires addressing trust, ethical considerations, and human resource management, underscoring the need for clear regulatory guidelines and ethical frameworks (Tveita & Hustad, 2025). When combined with blockchain technology, these benefits are further amplified. Related literature suggests that the integration of AI and blockchain provides stronger benefits than using either technology alone. Kumar et al. (2023) emphasized that AI–blockchain convergence improves data reliability and trust across business processes. Similarly, Lubis et al. (2025) noted that AI's analytical capabilities, when combined with blockchain's immutable ledger, significantly enhance accountability and transparency in e-governance systems. Blockchain technology further strengthens accountability and transparency in digital asset management through its immutable and decentralized framework, which reduces fraud risk and increases stakeholder trust (Priatmaja et al., 2024). These studies collectively show that integrated digital solutions are effective in addressing long-standing issues in public sector service delivery.

Research on e-government service quality demonstrates that high-quality digital services significantly impact citizen satisfaction and trust. Studies have found that e-government service quality, particularly information quality, positively influences citizen satisfaction, which in turn enhances citizen trust in government competence and service delivery (Pramuditha et al., 2024). This relationship underscores the importance of prioritizing service quality improvements in digital government initiatives to foster healthier relationships between government and citizens.

In the Philippine context, e-government initiatives have been implemented to modernize local governance; however, progress remains uneven. De Castro and De Castro (2022) found that many LGUs rely on fragmented systems, limited integration, and manual procedures despite having basic ICT initiatives. Studies on smart city development in the Philippines further reveal that the lack of standardization, coordination, and unified digital platforms hinders the full realization of e-governance benefits (Liponhay, 2023). Additionally, research on Philippine e-governance initiatives indicates that while some cities have introduced online portals, these systems are often incomplete and unable to fully consolidate transactions and records (IOER International Multidisciplinary Research Journal, 2023). Studies on LGU e-governance strategies reveal that implementation remains in early stages due to insufficient budgets, outdated technologies and infrastructure, and operations that are not fully optimized for ICT use (Correa et al., 2022). Research on digital transformation adoption in Philippine LGUs further identifies significant obstacles including budget limitations, skill gaps, cybersecurity issues, and user adoption challenges (Espiritu et al., 2023). Despite these challenges, digital transformation has contributed to increased operational efficiency, improved revenue collection, and enhanced citizen access to government services in some regions, though uneven digital adoption, infrastructure limitations, and capacity gaps persist (Cereno, 2024). Research on business permit systems in Philippine cities further demonstrates the importance of efficient permit processing. A study on Business Permits and Licensing System (BPLS) compliance in Iloilo City found that high satisfaction with BPLS requirements was strongly correlated with system efficiency, with businesses reporting that easy and efficient systems lead to improved compliance and more favorable business conditions (Niño & Gentoral, 2023). The study recommended fully implementing electronic BPLS systems as part of ease of doing business initiatives, highlighting the need for digital permit processing solutions that enhance both compliance and business satisfaction.

Despite existing efforts, significant gaps remain in business permit processing systems. Current challenges include manual document submission, repetitive requirements, delayed inspections, poor inter-office coordination, and weak record security. The digitalization of public services involving multiple offices requires effective coordination mechanisms, as the many actors involved in multi-office digital services need centralized coordination to benefit from both decentralized flexibility and centralized efficiency (Scholta et al., 2025). These limitations increase the risk of lost or altered records, reduce transparency, and make it difficult for LGUs to track compliance histories accurately. The reviewed studies indicate a lack of empirical implementations that combine AI-assisted validation and blockchain-based security in local-level permit systems, particularly in developing country settings (Lubis et al., 2025).

In Dagupan City, business permit processing involves multiple offices such as the Business Permit and Licensing Office (BPLO), Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP), Sanitary Office, Zoning Office, and Engineering Office. Business owners are typically required to submit physical documents and visit several offices to complete inspections and approvals. This process is largely manual, resulting in long queues, delayed approvals, difficulty in monitoring inspection status, and limited access to historical compliance records.

The current manual workflow in Dagupan City also poses challenges in terms of efficiency and accountability. Inspection results are recorded separately by different offices, making coordination difficult and slowing down decision-making. Retrieving records for verification or audit purposes is time-consuming, and the absence of a centralized system increases the risk of data inconsistencies and manipulation.

For instance,

To address these challenges, this study proposes BizClear, a blockchain-enhanced business permit processing and inspection tracking system with AI-assisted document validation. The proposed system will digitize permit application and renewal processes, automate inspection coordination among LGU offices, utilize AI to check document completeness and inconsistencies, and secure permit and inspection records using blockchain technology. Through these features, BizClear is expected to improve efficiency, transparency, accountability, and overall ease of doing business in Dagupan City.

## **Conceptual Framework**

This study adopts the Input–Process–Output (IPO) framework, which is appropriate for system development research as it illustrates how identified inputs are transformed through defined processes into desired outputs.

**Input.** The inputs of the study include the existing manual business permit processes, identified problems such as delays and fragmented inspections, user requirements from business owners and LGU personnel, and the proposed system features including AI-assisted document validation and blockchain-based record security.

**Process.** The process involves requirements gathering and workflow analysis, system design and development using the Scrum Agile methodology, implementation of AI-based document validation, integration of digital inspection workflows, blockchain hashing and recording of permit and inspection data, and system testing and evaluation.

**Output.** The expected output is a fully developed digital business permit processing and inspection tracking system. The system is expected to produce faster permit processing, improved document accuracy, secure and tamper-proof records, and enhanced monitoring and reporting capabilities for LGUs.

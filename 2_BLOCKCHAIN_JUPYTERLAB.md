# Opening, Installing, and Testing BlockchainAudit.ipynb in JupyterLab Instructions

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have created the `capstone_env` as described in `1_BLOCKCHAIN_ANACONDA.md`.

1. **Open Anaconda Navigator**
   - Start Menu → type "Anaconda Navigator" → Enter

2. **Select Your Environment (CRITICAL)**
   - Look for the dropdown menu labeled **"Applications on"** (usually at the top).
   - Change it from `base (root)` to **`capstone_env`**.
   - *Note: If you don't do this, you might not have access to your project's libraries.*

3. **Install/Launch JupyterLab**
   - If you see an **"Install"** button under JupyterLab, click it to install it into your environment.
   - Once installed, click **"Launch"**.

4. **Navigate to Project Folder**
   - In the JupyterLab file browser (left sidebar), navigate to:
     `Desktop/Capstone/blockchain/anaconda_projects/notebooks/`

5. **Open the Notebook**
   - Double-click `BlockchainAudit.ipynb`.

6. **Verify Kernel**
   - Look at the top-right corner of the notebook.
   - It should say **`Python 3 (ipykernel)`** or similar.
   - If it says "No Kernel" or "Error", click it and select the Python 3 kernel.

7. **Test the Notebook**
   - Click **Kernel** (top menu) → **Restart Kernel and Run All Cells**.
   - Scroll down to the bottom to ensure no errors occurred and the blockchain logic worked.

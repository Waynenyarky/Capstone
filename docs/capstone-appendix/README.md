# Capstone Document Appendix

This directory holds photos and documents for the capstone document appendices.

## Required Items (add manually)

Please add the following items collected during the BPLO field visit:

1. **Unified Business Permit Form** – photo or scan of the actual form
2. **General Permit Form** – CBPLO-GPI-F06 or equivalent
3. **Retirement Application Form** – letter to City Mayor through City Treasurer
4. **Occupational Permit Form** – CBPLO-OPR-F013
5. **ARTA Monitoring Form**
6. **Citizens Charter** – processing times and steps
7. **Post-Requirements Lists** – for new permits and renewals

## Usage

Reference these files in the capstone document (e.g., `capstone_document.md`) under the Appendices section.

## Note

The plan references "photos saved in /assets/" – this directory serves as the appendix storage location. Add files here and cite them in the capstone document.
